        Has one or many files that has been detected as minified JavaScript code. We
        use a package that will tell us if the code is minified (in case the file as
        a <b>.min</b> then we will consider the file minified by default).
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Minified JavaScript code are commonly used by hacker to obfuscate the code
        to avoid being spotted. A good practice is surely to check all the packages
        with the flag.
