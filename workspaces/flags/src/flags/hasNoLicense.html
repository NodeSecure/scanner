    <p>
        This flag mean that we have not detected any licenses in the npm Tarball (or
        something went wrong in the detection). For detecting licenses we are reading
        the <b>package.json</b> and searching for local files that contain the word <b>license</b>.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        The code and logic behind the detection is handled in the <a href="https://github.com/NodeSecure/scanner/tree/master/workspaces/tarball">@nodesecure/tarball</a> package.
