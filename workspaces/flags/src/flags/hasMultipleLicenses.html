    <p>
        We have detected different licenses in <b>package.json</b> and
        other licenses files (<b>LICENSE</b>,
        <b>LICENSE.MD</b> etc). This probably means that there is an
        inconsistency in the choice of the license (or a file not updated yet with
        the right license).
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        This flag has not been created to detect multiple licenses / conformance rules.
    </p>
    <p>Example: <span>ISC OR GPL-2.0-with-GCC-exception</span>.</p>

        Under the hood we use <a href="https://github.com/NodeSecure/scanner/tree/master/workspaces/conformance">@nodesecure/conformance</a> to assert licenses conformance!
